Public health informatics (PHI) is defined as the systematic application of information, computer science and technology in areas of public health, including surveillance, prevention, preparedness, and health promotion.

===

The main applications of PHI are 
1. promoting the health of the whole population, which will ultimately promote the health of individuals
2. preventing diseases and injuries by changing the conditions that increases the risk of the population

===

The scope of PHI includes the conceptualization, design, development, deployment, refinement, maintenance, and evaluation of communication, surveillance, and information systems relevant to public health.

===

The use of computerized global surveillance and data collection systems, such as health information exchange (HIE) and health information organization (HIO), could assist in population-level monitoring. This could help to avert the negative impact of a widespread global epidemic.

===

For instance, local or regional public health departments could alert all the clinicians within an HIO about unique cases of a highly resistant infectious organism or a widespread of communicable diseases. 

--

Consequently, HIO can play an important role as part of PHI in providing available patient data in conditions of natural disaster when paper-based records might be destroyed or unavailable.

===

The latest development of public health informatics, such as geographic information system (GIS) can be used to provide a large volume of data.

===

### Paper-based surveillance

--

This system was not quite efficient due to the variation in type of data reported between states. In addition, the dependence on a paper-based system and the delay in the identification of diseases affected the response rate and management of outbreaks.

--

These documents are separately assessed as cases, clusters or trends and therefore are time consuming, limited by incomplete data collection and inadequate analytical capacity. Thus, they are incapable of providing timely information for public health action. 

--

Another drawback of paper-based surveillance systems is the vulnerability of the paper records, especially during cases of natural disasters. Further, these systems do not help in the globalization of trends or data.

===

### Comparison between paper-based and electronic surveillance systems

--

The use of a geographic information system, such as HealthMap, has further improved the identification, monitoring, alerting and responding to emerging diseases, pandemics, bioterrorism and natural disasters, not only at the national but at the global level.

--

A surveillance study in Kenya about influenza and respiratory diseases was conducted using paper or smartphones surveys. This study included 2038 questionnaires, of which 1019 were paper based and 1019 were smartphone questionnaires.

===

### Applications of PHI

--

The data can be either a direct stream or aggregated data over time that are sent periodically through a secured connection to the surveillance systems. Data are then analyzed and converted to information by the usage of statistical algorithms that detect anomalies that could help to identify outbreaks.

--

PHI also played significant roles in responding to worldwide disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina and H1N1 influenza, shedding light on the importance and the role of public health in emergency disasters. This is realized by an up-to-date continuity of operations plan (COOP), which has an important role in preparation for disasters. This is achieved by collecting data, detecting a threat and responding to that threat correctly and suitable time.

--

For this to occur, HIE is also necessary together with well-established data standards (SNOMED, LONIC, HL7 and CHI), different databases, standards-based net- works, and strong security and decision support systems.

### Public health informatics in KSA

--

Several challenges were identified by the research team including the need for readiness assessment, resistance to change, integration of systems, and confidentiality and privacy of health information.

--

Another study cited the challenges relating to organizational and cultural issues, end user attitudes towards PHI projects, and the lack of specialized human resources to implement HIS.

--

Mobile apps and social media networks are widely used by the public and can be used as supporting tools added to the PHIN of disease surveillance.
