The aim of the third global survey on eHealth was to explore developments in eHealth since the last survey in 2010 and the role it plays in achieving universal health coverage (UHC).

--

This was acknowledged by the World Health Assembly in resolution WHA58.28 (2005): “eHealth is the cost-effective and secure use of ICT in support of health and health-related fields, including health-care services, health surveillance, health literature, and health education, knowledge and research.”

--

UHC is part of the “post-2015” agenda geared to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015.

--

Goal 3 is to “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” and its target 8 is to “Achieve universal health coverage”, so that all people receive the high-quality health services they need without suffering financial hardship.

### Electronic immunization registries, Latin America

--

Latin America is home to some of the oldest computerized immunization registers in the world. Since the late 1980s Uruguay’s immunization records have been detailed in a register. Since then, many countries in Latin America have been working toward implementing electronic immunization registries (EIRs), an important component of foundational eHealth systems.

--

Uruguay and Mexico were the first countries in Latin America to use computerized national immunization registries in 1987 and 1991 respectively.

--

An “ideal” EIR has been described as comprising:
- enrolment at birth
- an unique and unequivocal identifier or id
- information on vaccination provider, vaccine dose and date
- mechanisms for aggregating data at different geographical levels
- individualized follow-up of vaccination schedules to allow for automated recall/reminders
- data security and protection of patient confidentiality
- data entry as close to vaccination as possible (time and place) (2).

--

The Improving Data Quality for Immunization Project in Latin America exists to help countries decide whether, when and how to introduce and/or expand EIRs. Workshops are regularly held on the topic and best practices identified from various countries include the following.

--

- Objectives and the scope of the EIR should be clearly established before development.
- Implementation of the EIR should be monitored in order to address problems as soon as possible.
- Data flow and processes should be clearly identified at the start of the project.
- An unique identifier should be used or created, as well as capturing the entire target population.
- EIRs need to be flexible enough to accommodate new vaccines, new schedules, etc.
- EIRs require investments in time and financial commitments during their entire life cycle (2).

--

*“Experience in the Americas has indicated that it is critical to have a complete picture of the final system from the beginning and keeping in mind that the data to be collected needs to fulfil specific actions including strategic decisions, operational decisions and managerial decisions. In order to facilitate the sharing of experiences, case studies may prove useful.”*

– Marcela Contreras, PAHO/WHO

--

The Latin American Regional Immunization Action Plan for the 2016-2020 period recognizes the progress made in the elimination and control of vaccine-preventable diseases and that work must still be done so that access to vaccination helps bring health services to all through a comprehensive approach that considers the social determinants of health and universal coverage. It also recognizes EIRs as useful tools to achieve these goals.

mHealth

mSehat, Uttar Pradesh, India

--

mSehat1 is an integrated, Android and web-based, multimedia-enabled mobile health platform for frontline health workers, which includes accredited social health activists (ASHAs), Anganwadi workers (AWWs) auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and health programme managers. mSehat was named after the Hindi word for health, “sehat”, and assists these workers via an integrated service- delivery platform accessible via smartphones, tablets and web-based dashboard reporting.

--

However, there were a number of gaps that needed to be addressed to realize the full potential of the MCTS system, including:
- lack of an efficient data entry system resulting in a duplication of efforts to collect and record data;
- suboptimal pace of data entry;
- burdensome level of data collection, such as multiple paper-based records (registers weighing in access of 1kg).

--

mSehat uses a mobile platform to:
- provide on-demand training and information to frontline health workers using multimedia enabled content;
- provide a multimedia job-aid to frontline health workers for registration, tracking, counselling, reporting, screening and referral;
- facilitate monitoring of demand, supply and consumption of medicine stocks;
- create an incentive monitoring system for ASHAs, so they can be rewarded for their work;
- strengthen MCTS through real-time updating of workplans, and service delivery information.

--

Owning a mobile phone is a status symbol in India, so there has been a real sense of empowerment among the workers and their families. There have been some challenges, such as dealing with cases of theft of the phones and tablets and only having electricity for 10 hours per day on average. To overcome this the vendor agreed to replace lost or stolen devices within 15 days, and service centres were set-up in each district.

--

*“There was a time when we used to give tablets (medicines) to help people and now the time has come when we are given tablets (mobile devices) and they are helping us all.”*

– Phoolan Kushwaha, ANM of 25 years

### TeleHealth

- the delivery of health care services, where patients and providers are separated by distance. Telehealth uses ICT for the exchange of information for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health professionals. Telehealth can contribute to achieving universal health coverage by improving access for patients to quality, cost-effective, health services wherever they may be. It is particularly valuable for those in remote areas, vulnerable groups and ageing populations.

--

- Teleradiology is a field of telehealth using ICT to transmit digital radiological images for diagnosis or consultation.
- Teledermatology is a field of telehealth using ICT to transmit medical information concerning skin conditions for the purpose of diagnosis or consultation.
- Telepathology is a field of telehealth using ICT to transmit digitized pathological results, such as microscopic images of cells, for the purpose of diagnosis or consultation.
- Telepsychiatry is a field of telehealth using ICT to provide mental health services.
- Remote patient monitoring is an increasingly important field of telehealth where patients, often at home, transmit information about their condition from sensors and monitoring equipment to external monitoring centres.

--

Level of operation

1. International level: health entities in other countries in the world.
2. Regional level: health entities in countries in the same geographic region.
3. National level: referral hospitals, laboratories and health institutes (mainly public, but also private).
4. Intermediate level (covering district or provincial facilities): public, private profit-making and private non-profit-making (e.g. religious) hospitals and health centres.
5. Local or peripheral level: health posts, health centres providing basic level of care.

#### telemedicine

Peek Vision, Kenya

--

- The Portable Eye Examination Kit (Peek) is a unique smartphone-based system that can be used for comprehensive eye testing anywhere in the world. Peek Acuity, the app used to test eyesight easily and affordably using a smartphone, is as accurate as traditional Snellen charts (1). The Peek Retina adapter slips neatly over the built-in camera on a smartphone. Used in conjunction with the Peek app, users hold the phone close to someone’s eye and it will auto-focus to show the retina on screen. It gives high-resolution images of the eye at a fraction of the cost of traditional ophthalmic equipment, which can be difficult and time-consuming to use.

--

*“More people in Kenya, and in sub-Saharan Africa, have access to a mobile phone than clean running water. So we said, could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way? And so we developed Peek, a smartphone [system] that enables community health care workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.”*

– Dr Andrew Bastawrous, co-founder of Peek

--

*“Our ultimate hope is that the accuracy and easy-to-use features of Peek will lead to more people receiving timely and appropriate treatment and being given the chance to see clearly again.”*

– Dr Andrew Bastawrous, co-founder of Peek

--

Development of the Peek model includes the following.
- Observe – define the barriers and needs.
- Innovate – create low cost solutions.
- Validate – prototype, clinical trials, iterate, prove.
- Scale – implement through partnerships.

eLearning

--

![image.png](/api/media/2019-10-24t143955.301z)

--

The survey asked about the way health sciences teaching institutions were using eLearning, listing six categories.
- Developing courses for use by their own students.
- Using courses developed by other institutions.
- Teaching pre-clinical subjects.
- Teaching clinical subjects.
- Developing courses for use by other institutions.
- Teaching subjects where specialists are unavailable at the institution.

--

Evaluation
- These findings show a clear and a widespread need for evaluation of pre- and in-service eLearning programmes. Considering the prevalent use of eLearning courses developed by other institutions, the rates of eLearning evaluation and accreditations should increase. Another major issue is the limited scope of existing evaluations as they are typically restricted to learners’ enjoyment and satisfaction with the courses (5). Evaluation of eLearning programmes should entail both learners’ and providers’ standpoints and focus on a range of elements such as cost-effectiveness, acceptance, access, achievement of learning outcomes, quality of the programme, etc.

===

eLearning

eLearning programme in Afghanistan and Pakistan

--

The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) set up an eLearning programme1 in Afghanistan in 2010, which expanded to Tajikistan in 2013, Pakistan in 2015 and Kyrgyzstan in 2015. In 2011 the AKDN eHealth Resource Centre (eHRC)2 was established to provide strategic eHealth support to the AKDN health agencies and their partner health institutions with managing eHealth operations, such as the eLearning programme.

--

*“When I was moving from a very well-renowned teaching hospital to the hardship and relatively less developed area of Gilgit, I was excited about the opportunity to contribute, but also very concerned about my continuous learning and professional development. To my happiness and surprise, an eHealth link was established here at Aga Khan Medical Centre, Gilgit, for eLearning sessions from the Aga Khan University.”*

– Dr Nasreen Muhammad Saleem, Internal Medicine Specialist, Aga Khan Medical Centre, Gilgit

--

- *“I have been working at Bamyan Provincial Hospital since 2003. Before the eLearning programme became available in 2010, accessing professional development courses was very difficult. I had to travel either to Kabul (3 hours away) or to Takhar province (6 hours away) from Bamyan to avail the sessions. Even then, not all staff could go together as some had to stay behind to attend to patients. Only a few staff could go at a time. This was expensive and very time-consuming. Now, with the eLearning courses being broadcast directly from Kabul, we can attend the sessions right here without leaving the hospital. I attend two sessions a month now compared to one session a year when I had to travel to Kabul or to Takhar province.”*

– Chaman Ali, Nurse in-Charge, Bamyan Provincial Hospital, Afghanistan

--

An impact evaluation research study is currently under way evaluating the efficacy of the eLearning intervention on improving maternal, neonatal and child health knowledge and practices at all sites in Afghanistan and the Khorog Oblast General Hospital in Tajikistan. The strengths and weaknesses of the eLearning approach and factors that lead to the success or failure of such interventions in health care settings of low- and middle-income countries will also be identified. The research study is projected to be completed by early 2017.

--

Future plans include analysing and evaluating lessons learned from the eLearning programme in central Asia with a view to implementing a similar eLearning programme in Kenya.

### Electronic health records

The most frequently cited barriers to the implementation of EHRs were lack of funding, infrastructure, capacity and legal frameworks.

--

- *real-time, patient-centred records that provide immediate and secure information to authorized users. EHRs typically contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses and treatment, medications, allergies, immunizations, as well as radiology images and laboratory results. A National Electronic Health Records system is most- often implemented under the responsibility of the national health authority and will typically make a patient’s medical history available to health professionals in health care institutions and provide linkages to related services such as pharmacies, laboratories, specialists, and emergency and medical imaging facilities.*

===

My eHealth Record, Northern territory, Australia

--

The My eHealth Record (MeHR), an electronic shared record service, was established to address the fragmentation of health information for a predominantly Indigenous and mobile population with multiple health concerns. It has been operating since 2005 in the Northern Territory as well as in surrounding regions of Central Australia.

--

The MeHR service has proven to be an invaluable resource. The main benefits have been outlined in the evaluation report (5), which states that the MeHR service:
- increases access to health information
- reduces time spent sourcing information
- supports clinical decision-making
- increases provider and consumer confidence
- improves continuity of care
- increases capacity to deliver population-based primary health care.

--

*“There was an Indigenous lady who moved into the community, because her family were living there. She’s got dementia and she had a stroke. She came in from [community omitted] so she had nothing; no record. I went into her eHealth record and that’s where I found everything I needed.”*

-- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioner

--

The record is predominantly used by providers in four main scenarios:
1. for investigative purposes (Who is this patient? What medications are they on?);
2. opportunistically (a trigger or prompt during consultation may cause the provider to look for more information);
3. targeted (to find a specific piece of information);
4. to supplement local clinical records.

--

-  Consider Charlie Tjami, a 41-year-old father of two who lives in remote community Amoonguna, 15 km south-east of Alice Springs. He is experiencing shortness of breath and a tight chest. His general practitioner at the local Aboriginal community health centre refers him to Alice Springs hospital where he has an electrocardiogram. He is then referred to Royal Adelaide Hospital for further tests and undergoes a multiple coronary artery bypass and mitral value surgery. After 10 days he is discharged home to his community. Throughout this clinical event he has travelled over 8000 km, across two states, and has been treated by many providers. During this time his health care providers were able to rely on the information in his MeHR service, predominantly at the critical points of clinical handover.

===

### Legal frameworks for eHealth

--

- Slow but steady development of a general eHealth regulation: 33% of responding Member States (n=39) have policies or legislation to define medical jurisdiction, liability or reimbursement of eHealth services, while 47% (n=58) have legislation to promote safety, quality and standards of health related data.
- Good advances in adoption of health data privacy legislation: 78% of responding countries (n=98) reported having legislation to protect privacy of personal information, and 55% (n=68) legislation to protect the privacy of electronically held patient data is a good indicator. These numbers have risen from 73% and 31% respectively since the 2010 survey.

--

- Slow adoption of legislation to facilitate international sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data for patient care: 34% (n=43) reported having legislation to covering sharing of health related patient data between health care professionals within the same country, and but only 22% (n=28) have legislation which addresses sharing such data internationally.

--

- Slow but steady development of patients’ rights with respect to electronically held health data: 29% of countries (n=36) reported that legislation had been adopted to ensure patients can access EHRs, and almost the same number (28%) reported that legislation gives patients the right to define who may access the record. Thirty-two per cent reported that a patient may demand to have an error in an EHR corrected, but only 18% provide for the deletion of an entry in a record.

--

- Note: the survey questions focused particularly on the regulatory aspects of the use of electronic health data and EHRs. While electronic data and EHRs are only one element of a well-functioning eHealth system, it may be argued that they are the basis of eHealth systems, and as such the maturity of regulation of electronic health data and EHRs may be taken as a good indicator of maturity of the general eHealth regulatory framework. The fact that the focus of the questions was significantly on EHRs implies, however, that countries which do not use electronic records are not covered in detail in this review.

--

The study identified the following list of key regulatory issues relevant for eHealth in Sub-Saharan Africa:
- access to and ownership of data
- security and access to clinical information systems by patients and care provider
- privacy and confidentiality
- informed consent for data use
- data ownership
- access rights to patient data
- integrity of data
- patient safety

--

- secure transmission of patient data
- electronic and physical security
- reliability of electronic portable medical devices used with ehealth
- accuracy and reliability of online information for patients
- sustainability of accuracy and integrity of electronic patient medical records
- validity and reliability of clinical decision support systems
- quality of care using ehealth processes
- availability of efficient and effective communication systems for transferring patient data
- reliability and dependability of telemedicine and telemonitoring.

--

- The legal baseline
- Privacy for patient data and patient data held in electronic form
- Sharing and use of health related data
  - sharing data between health care professionals in-country
  - sharing data between health care professionals internationally
  - sharing data for research purposes
- Electronic access
  - Correction
  - Deletion
  - Access control

--

- Considerable and positive advances have been made since 2010, but work needs to continue globally and with special focus on developing countries.
- A positive trend in respect for privacy of health data can be seen, although more targeted legislation may be appropriate; a more coherent approach on wider patients’ rights in the context of eHealth is needed in many jurisdictions.

--

- Good advances have been made in accommodating core eHealth tools, such as EHRs, into legal frameworks, but many countries still have some way to go in developing robust governance to support the use mHealth and telehealth solutions for health care delivery systems.
- A general lack of coherence in addressing the legal needs of full integration into health care systems is evident in many regions, particularly in developing countries. This is undermining the return-on-investment that could be achieved for eHealth and its potential to be an accelerator in achieving UHC targets.

===

### social media

--

- Nearly 80% of responding Member States reported health care organizations use social media for promotion of health messages (n=98; 78%).
- Nearly 80% of countries reported that individuals and communities use social media primarily to learn about health issues (n=99; 79%), while in over 62% of countries there are individuals and communities using social media to run community-based health campaigns.
- Social media is an important means of conveying messages for health organizations and of receiving and sharing information for individuals and communities, but there is still much to be done to understand how best its potential can be used, e.g. to support universal health coverage (UHC).

--

- National policies or strategies for social media
- Use of social media by health organizations
  - Help manage patient appointments
  - seek feedback on services
  - Emergency announcements
  - General health announcements
  - Promotion of health messages
- Use of social media by individuals and communities
  - Decide what health services to use
  - Community-based health forums
  - Provide feedback to health facilities or health professionals
  - Run community-based health campaigns
  - Learn about health issues

#### Break Dengue, Brussels, Belgium/global

--

- Break Dengue is an initiative that was created in August 2013 to combat dengue fever – a neglected global disease from which approximately half of the world’s population is at risk. Break Dengue is built on partnerships which bring together all stakeholders by encouraging them to examine the bigger picture of dengue, not just single aspects such as vector control or vaccine development. Essentially, Break Dengue encourages its partners to look at dengue from a public health and patient perspective, at the disease as a whole and its impact on society. It identifies the most successful dengue prevention initiatives from around the world to help replicate them in other countries. This brings patients closer to potential treatments and disseminates effective dengue prevention strategies, which heretofore were very fragmented.

--

*“Due to the complex nature of dengue fever transmission, efforts to decrease its spread require both effective collaborative models to bring together diverse stakeholders, and approaches that leverage the power and scalability that our connected world offers. By combining both of these aspects, Break Dengue is ideally positioned to catalyse the conception and implementation of innovative solutions to curb dengue.”*

– MauricioSantillana Mauricio Santillana, PhD, is a physicist and applied mathematician, and is a faculty member at Boston Children’s Hospital

--

Break Dengue set about creating a global online community. The first step was a Facebook page to build a core audience. This page now has over 250 000 followers and averages over 1000 “likes” per day. Utilizing boosted posts2, the page quickly grew and “DengueBreakers” have grown into an army to help spread the message and raise awareness of the disease. The team uses Pinterest3 to target more visual users through eye-catching informative images and infographics. Using Google+4 the team was able to optimize search engine results more readily.

--

On Twitter, they took a different approach. @BreakDengue is not only focused on raising public awareness on dengue prevention, but also seeks out and builds strategic relationships with key opinion leaders on dengue worldwide. These include experts from the pharmaceutical industry, medical professionals, health care analysts, educators, marketing professionals for the health care sector, activists and other organizations that share the same goal.

--

Simultaneously the “Dengue Lab” was created, an online community of 1000 experts working on the prevention, surveillance or treatment of dengue fever. It enables members to share best practices, data, and their experiences and insights on dengue fever to inspire concrete actions at the global and local levels for the control of the disease.

--

The information provided online currently is available in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Plans include reproducing it in other languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Bengali, Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai and Malaysian. The majority of followers in the online communities are from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil and Mexico. While Break Dengue was founded in Belgium, it is a truly global initiative using digital channels and social media to connect citizens and reduce the incidences of dengue worldwide, thereby contributing to UHC. 5

--

*“What makes Break Dengue unique is the unprecedented level of partnership; coming together asone to fight against a disease against which no prevention or cure currently exists. Break Dengue is the perfect example of identifying a need for something bigger in the fight for disease awareness; and demonstrates an ideal model which could be replicated for so many other diseases across the globe.”*

– Paul Simms, Chairman of eyeforpharma

--

Break Dengue has partnered with the HealthMap6 team at Boston Children’s Hospital who has been successful at developing accurate methods to produce real-time and forecast estimates of flu incidence. Together they hope to create an innovative internet-based surveillance platform for dengue that will depend in part on the data generated by their social media friends and followers.

### Big data

- Less than a fifth of countries (17%; n=21) reported having a national policy or strategy regulating the use of big data in the health sector.
- Lack of integration and privacy and security were the major barriers to adopting big data to support UHC indicated by responding Member States (72% and 68% respectively).

--

Wyber et al. (5) suggest that the “best case” model for deploying big data would be associated with an approach in which:
- health data are owned by patients
- there are robust governance structures and laws regarding the use of data (including when and how anonymized data can be shared)
- interoperability standards exist and are implemented
- data are presented in a usable format to patients, health care providers, entrepreneurs and policy-makers.

--

In worst-case scenarios, however, big data would be an expensive distraction driven by high-income countries, focused on disease specific outcomes and unintelligible to those who most need data access. Breaches of data security could threaten personal safety, and the global health community could oversee the spending of huge amounts of money on big data, with potentially little to show for the investment.

The survey studied eight key themes in eHealth:
- Foundations for eHealth
- mHealth
- Telehealth
- eLearning
- Electronic health records
- Legal frameworks for eHealth
- Social media
- Big data
