This report proposes a vision for informatics in enhancing public health surveillance, identifies challenges and opportunities, and suggests approaches to attain the vision. 

--

This topic was identified by CDC leadership as one of six major concerns that must be addressed by the public health community to advance public health surveillance in the 21st century. The six topics were discussed by CDC workgroups that were convened as part of the 2009 Surveillance Consultation to advance public health surveillance to meet continuing and new challenges.

===

The work of public health informatics can be divided into three categories. 
- First is the study and description of complex systems (e.g., models of disease transmission or public health nursing work flow). 
- Second is the identification of opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health systems through innovative data collection or use of information. 
- Third is the implementation and maintenance of processes and systems to achieve such improvements.

===

The informatics perspective can provide insights and opportunities to improve each of the seven ongoing elements of any public health surveillance system. Examples include the following:
- Planning and system design
- Data collection
- Data management and collation
- Analysis
- Interpretation
- Dissemination
- Application to public health programs
