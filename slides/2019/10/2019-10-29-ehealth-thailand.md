## THIS

Thai Health Information Standards Development Center

--

Vision:
- Thailand has national health information standards which enable seamless health information exchanges for better health care of Thai people. The standards are accepted and adopted by all Thai health system stakeholders and are compatible with international standards.

--

Mission: 
- To develop and facilitate the development of Thailand health information standards in order to achieve health information systems interoperability with the ultimate goal of better health care.

--

Objectives:
- To develop and facilitate the development of national standards of health information system, that can be exchanged at all levels
- To develop standard health information systems guidelines for the stakeholders
- To encourage and support the knowledge creation and knowledge management and continuous development of human resources in Biomedical and Health Informatics and Health Information Systems
- To establish and expand knowledge network of HIS, HIT and eHealth with stakeholders at both domestic and international level.

- Governance and leadership of national eHealth systems are essential and critical for the country to achieve interoperability through health data standards.
- Incentives and mandates from the governing body that has authority are important to the adoption of standards.
- Standards maintenance process is a necessary component of successful implementation of every standard.
- Advocacy on the potential benefits from using data standards as well as communication between the organizations and the users are of importance.
- Human resource in health informatics is an important component and building capacity for them is essential.

The WHO-ITU National eHealth Strategy toolkit identifies important seven building blocks or components that must be in place to realize the national eHealth vision. The seven components are:
- leadership and governance
- strategy and investment
- legislation policy and compliance
- workforce
- infrastructure
- services and applications
- standards and interoperability.

## tHai medicineS terminology (tmt)

--

THIS has set up principles for health information standards development, which are;
1. Develop health information standards that can be used with many functions in the healthcare systems.
2. Take into account Thai healthcare context in the standards development process.
3. Don’t reinvent the wheel; the standards should be built on a country’s previous works.
4. Comply with international standards.

1. generAl informAtion About loinc

The advantages of LOINC are as follows:
- Well-designed; LOINC is designed to uniquely identify laboratory and clinical observation.
- Coverage; LOINC contains 76,266 terms covering more than 95% of laboratory tests worldwide.
- Widely acceptable; more than 160 countries use LOINC in their healthcare systems.
- Maintenance; the Regenstrief Institute develops, maintains, and updates LOINC twice a year.
- Free of charge; LOINC materials are registered under United States trademarks of Regenstrief Institute, Inc.

2. feAsibility of ADopting loinc for thAilAnD heAlthcAre system

The unmapped test can be categorized into four certain types
- Not enough laboratory detail; the tests that do not have enough information of axes for mapping with LOINC Code
- Not a laboratory test; the local (test) names in LIS are not laboratory tests
- Out of scope of LOINC; the tests that are not under LOINC scope
- Cannot find in LOINC; the tests that do not exist in LOINC database, but within LOINC scope mentioned in LOINC guidebook.

===

 With these barriers in mind, we recommend the following steps for the development of health information standards in Thailand:
- Governance and leadership of national eHealth systems are essential and critical for country to achieve interoperability through health data standards.
- Incentives and mandates from the governing body that has authority are important to the adoption of standards.

- Standards maintenance process is a necessary component of successful implementation of every standard.
- Advocacy on the potential benefits from using data standards as well as communication between the organizations and the users are of importance.
- Human resource in health informatics is an important component and building capacity for them is essential.
