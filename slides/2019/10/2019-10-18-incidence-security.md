This wasn’t the first major hack by the North Korean hacking group. Lazarus was responsible for the massive hack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh Central Bank in 2016.

### Singapore personal data hack hits 1.5m, health authority says

Singapore, 2015

--

Those targeted visited clinics between 1 May 2015 and 4 July of this year.

Data taken include names and addresses but not medical records, other than medicines dispensed in some cases.

"Information on the outpatient dispensed medicines of about 160,000 of these patients" was taken, the statement says.

--

It appears that a computer belonging to SingHealth, one of the state's two major government healthcare groups, was infected with malware through which the hackers gained access to the database.

--

SingHealth has temporarily banned staff from accessing the internet on all 28,000 of its work computers, according to the Straits Times.

The move is aimed at plugging leaks from work e-mails and shared documents as well as guarding against possible cyber-attacks.

--

The government has previously warned of cyber-attacks, saying it has been the target of international hackers, but most attacks were foiled.

It has stepped up measures in recent years, including disconnecting computers for certain key ministries in the civil service from the internet, so that they operate on intranet only.

--

Singapore is not the only country to be subjected to high-profile attacks by hacking groups. Others include:

- Earlier this year, Germany's government IT network was attacked by hackers targeting the interior ministries' private networks. It was reported that a group known as Fancy Bear was responsible
- In February, the US and UK said that the Russian military was behind a "malicious" cyber-attack on Ukraine last year that spread globally. Moscow denied being behind the attack

--

- A cyber-attack crippled the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and other organisations around the world in May last year. A hacking group in North Korea known as Lazarus is believed to have launched the attack, which involved malware known as WannaCry
- In 2014, the US claimed that North Korea was behind cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, after the entertainment company released a film featuring the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un

SamSam ransomware hackers bank $6 million and counting from victims

2015-2018

--

With an estimated new victim each day, a recent report from cybersecurity firm Sophos found that about one out of four victims paid at least some of the ransom. To make matters worse: Hackers have steadily increased the ransom demand since the attack began to spike in January.

--

The results were damning for the U.S. and for the healthcare industry. About 75 percent of SamSam’s victims were in the U.S. and 26 percent of those happened in the healthcare industry. In fact, the other sectors, government and education, had fewer victims combined.

--

SamSam is not a new virus, but attacks have exponentially increased throughout 2018. The first major publicized healthcare victim was Allscripts. Hackers breached the EHR company’s data centers on Jan. 18, and the platform did not return to normal operations for more than a week.

--

SamSam took down the Atlanta government for several days, and within a few weeks of Allscripts two Indiana-based providers fell victim, Hancock Health and Adams Memorial. Hancock Health admitted to paying the ransom to regain its data.

--

These attacks got the attention of the government and the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS released an alert in April, warning the sector that the hackers had already claimed 10 organizations in three short months.

--

Shortly after the alert, Indiana's Allied Physicians of Michiana fell victim to SamSam on May 17. And July reportedly claimed two more healthcare victims: Cass Regional Medical Center and medical testing giant LabCorp. Both faced network interruptions lasting about a week.

--

But hospitals that fail to monitor an abnormal number of login attempts are incredibly vulnerable, as are those that use weak or reused passwords or fail to limit admin credentials.

--

SamSam is spread through the web, Java apps and other web-based apps. And once it’s in the system, it spreads without malicious emails. While the virus can be stopped if detected before it gets into the system, it’s over once it has breached the network.

--

Hackers scan the internet to find open remote desktop protocol connections or JBoss servers and use either brute force attacks or access or password vulnerabilities on these endpoints.

--

HHS recommends restricting access behind firewalls and using two-factor authentication. Organizations need to limit who has access to RDPs and use an account lockout policy, the key method for stopping brute force attacks.

--

With RDP backdoors being sold for just $10 on the dark web and thousands of these ports added to the marketplace daily, these attacks won’t stop until healthcare locks down all its endpoints.

### Global Wanna'Cry attack

2017-05-12

--

WannaCry hit computers around the world on May 12, including many in the healthcare sector. Several U.S. health systems were impacted, while at least 16 U.K. National Health Services’ trusts were knocked offline. The attack crippled the organization: Staff were unable to access patient data, and ambulances were diverted to other locations.

--

North Korea was directly responsible for the WannaCry ransomworm that infected over 300,000 devices in more than 150 countries in May, the Trump administration’s Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert announced Monday night in a Wall Street Journal blog post.

### HHS HCCIC cybersecurity alert: New Ryuk ransomware quickly racking up damage

Similar to the notorious SamSam variant that has wreaked havoc on the healthcare sector, the new ransomware only infects crucial assets and resources.

2018-09-05

--

Ryuk isn’t technically advanced, but the highly targeted, planned ransomware variant has several interesting features that ensures its victims are hit hard, according to research from Check Point.

--

For example, after a computer is encrypted, Ryuk will destroy its encryption key and launch a BAT file that will remove any shadow copies and backup files from the device.

--

Instead, Ryuk is exclusively used for tailored attacks, with an encryption scheme designed for small-scale operations. Even worse, officials said the hackers perform extensive network mapping, hacking and credential collection before every attack.

--

So far, Ryuk hackers have caused more than $640,000 in damage, according to Bleeping Computer’s Catalin Cimpanu. And Check Point found some hackers demanding ransoms as high as $320,000 (50 bitcoins).
