The enterprise architecture is the next level of elaboration of the HMN Framework where general lessons, standards, and processes can be aggregated and documented for knowledge sharing.

===

A national health information system (HIS) plays an important role in ensuring that reliable and timely health information is available for operational and strategic decision making that saves lives and enhances health.

--

Despite their importance for evidence-based decisions, health information systems in many developing countries are weak, fragmented and often focused exclusively on disease-specific program areas.

--

There is a broad consensus in the literature that the strengthening of national HIS is desirable.

--

An integrated HIS will provide the basis for public health professionals to look at the health system from broader, more comprehensive points of view.

--

A common vision of a national HIS allows for leveraging the gains in tools and methods achieved in vertical disease-specific programs and maintaining the effectiveness of those systems to build a stronger integrated foundation addressing the entire health system.

--

Absence of integrated information and use effectively ensures duplication and places a heavy burden on health workers caused by redundant, fragmented, and inconsistent methods and instruments for data collection, aggregation, and reporting.

--

There are many examples of information and communication technology being introduced that show great promise in strengthening health information systems, but these efforts too often are fragmented in design, and implementation is typically not systematic or scalable.

===

Health Metrics Network

--

Health Metrics Network (HMN) was launched in 2005 to help ministries of health, stakeholders and partners improve global health by improving the availability and use of health information to advance evidence-based decision making.

--

HMN is the first global-health partnership that focuses on two core requirements of health system strengthening in low and low-middle income countries: 
- first, to address a vision of an information system that embraces the health system and its component parts as a whole, moving beyond specific diseases and programs; and 
- secondly, to draw attention to and invest in country leadership and ownership in strengthening health information management and use.

===

A Framework for Health Information System Strengthening

--

The HMN Framework draws on a set of guiding operating principles that have evolved through the active participation of more than 65 countries and numerous partners to date. The principles that provide the direction for the development of the framework are as follows:

--

1. Routine use of better information is associated with better health outcomes and a strengthened national HIS is one essential mechanism for delivering capacity.

--

2. Fostering country leadership and ownership is necessary for sustaining gains in health, strengthening health systems, and enabling health information system.

--

3. Country requirements and implementation challenges must be thoroughly understood and directly addressed for a national HIS to be effective.

--

4. Improving health, health policy, and health system performance requires national, broad-based stakeholder consensus and stakeholder commitment.

--

5. Health information system strengthening requires a long-term strategic plan with short-term pragmatic action plans that build on successive coordinated incremental steps.

===

An Architectural Approach to Health Information System Strengthening

--

Ministries of health and their stakeholders have begun to voice the need for a more detailed technical elaboration of the HMN Framework to support focused investments and the mobilization of a wider pool of leaders and advocates of health information.

--

Enterprise architecture (EA) is a comprehensive description of all of the key elements and relationships that make up an organization.

It is used to define the alignment of an organization’s mission, goals, and objectives with information systems.

--

Since its development in 1984, the EA approach has been applied by many companies, governments and other institutions worldwide in order to improve their business process (e.g. the U.S. Department of Defense, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and commercial firms like BP (British Petroleum), Intel and Volkswagen). 

Global organizations like the World Bank are viewing EA as an enabler to broad reforms in the public sector.

--

An EA approach to health information systems development allows for important interrelationships to be identified, including which components need to be aligned to which parts and in so doing reduce the risks and incentives of fragmentation, and duplication, and lack of interoperability.

--

Beyond the focus on the public health sector the general government sector has emerged as the area of largest implementation of enterprise architecture.

--

The EA will also serve as a global repository for lessons learned—standards and tools that countries, donors, developers, and partners worldwide can apply to strengthen health information systems.

--

An EA is not a static documentation of the system. Rather, it allows for a long-term aspiration vision while enabling practical stepwise progress that is informed by continuous experience and feedback.

===

The Role of the Enterprise Architecture in Alignment and Consensus Building

--

The EA for a national HIS will describe the fundamental organization of the system embodied in its components, standards, and the principles governing its design and evolution.

===

National HIS Enterprise Architecture Domains

--

There are a range of alternatives for developing an EA including the Zachman Framework, the Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture and the Gartner Methodology.

--

In the practice of developing an EA, the most common approach is often a blend of existing methods that address the specific challenges of the enterprise setting. This blended approach holds promise for developing the Reference National HIS Enterprise Architecture.

--

Commonly there are layers or domains of an architecture that are subsets of an overall enterprise architecture. Four layers are commonly defined in a general model of an enterprise architecture.
- Organizational Architecture
- Data Architecture
- Applications Architecture
- Technical Architecture

===

Organizational Architecture

--

Who are key decision makers, what are their roles and behaviors insofar as decision making is concerned?

--

What are the essential questions that users must be able to answer for strategic and day-to-day decision making?

--

What core business processes (i.e. health services delivery, laboratory, and pharmacy) are necessary to support decision making?

--

What policies and laws are necessary to support the initial development and implementation of a national HIS?

--

What resources are necessary to establish the minimum capacity for a sustainable HIS?

--

Who will be responsible for the maintenance of the integrity of the national HIS?

===

Data Architecture

--

What are the essential core and common data necessary to support information and evidence for decision makers?

--

What data sources contain these data and what can be linked for use from existing operational systems (for example the national census, vital registration or surveillance systems)?

--

What is the link between essential minimum data sets and global program M&E?

===

Applications Architecture

--

What are the initial key applications a minimal national HIS must be able to deliver? Examples include standard data-collection instruments, data communication services, data analysis and modeling, report generator, and GIS.

--

What applications are best included within a single platform design versus those applications that are best maintained as separate operational systems?

--

How will applications that have a requirement to be linked be able to be linked?

--

How should the user interface work?

===

Technical Architecture

--

What are the requirements for information to be captured, data entered, tagged, communicated, managed, and disseminated?

--

What is the minimum information and communication technology capacity needed across the country to support access to the applications and the dissemination of information?

--

How will new classes of electronic devices, communication networks and related ICT be leveraged over the next 5 to 7 years?

===

Scoping the Enterprise Architecture Program of Work

--

An important step in developing the enterprise architecture is to establish the initial scope. A scope allows for the careful consideration and definition of what is appropriate and of the highest priority.

--

The Architecture Development Method (ADM) is useful in the discussion of the importance of scope and how one might blend different models. There are four main dimensions in which scope may be defined and limited:
- Enterprise scope or focus
- Architectural domains
- Vertical scope or level of detail
- Time horizon

--

**Enterprise scope or focus**: what is the full extent of the enterprise and how much of that enterprise should the architecture focus on?

--

**Architectural domains**: a complete enterprise architecture description should contain all four architecture domains (business, data, applications, and infrastructure), but resource constraints will impact the extent of the architecture even if the full enterprise is limited.

--

**Vertical scope or level of detail**: how much of architecture is enough before implementation activities including system design, system engineering, and system development can begin?

--

**Time horizon**: what is the time horizon for a complete architecture and do resource constraints require intermediate *Target Architectures* to be defined that enable implementation activities to begin?

===

The incredible surge in health funding has created a plethora of tools, methods, and practices for data collection and analysis that have placed a counterproductive and unsustainable burden on front-line health workers. There is a growing consensus that this burden not only causes poor data quality, but also diverts critical health resources from patient care responsibilities.

--

The challenge of how to improve the current situation is one that an enterprise architecture can help address. By providing an architecture that is scalable, flexible and resilient, donors, governments, NGOs and commercial suppliers can contribute to the development of tools and methods that reuse components and leverage core and common data and standards. These will reduce—and not add— to the burden of data collection.
