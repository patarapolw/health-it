# The Past

===

## Records of Major Epidemics in Human History.

--

According to Marks and Beatty, the three most devastating epidemics to hit the human race were 
- “The Plague of Justinian” (A.D. 541–591) which lasted 50 years, 
- ”The Black Death” (1348–1351) which lasted 4 years, and 
- “Spanish Influenza” (1918) which lasted five months.

--

From an analysis of Table 1, it can be seen that three types of information were included in the historical records of epidemics. These are 
- health outcomes, 
- risk factors, and 
- interventions

  - First link of surveillance to legislation: Sir Edwin Chadwick used surveillance data to demonstrate the link between poverty and disease [31]. This led to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.
- 1838 (England)
  - Founder of the modern concept of surveillance: William Farr was appointed as the first Compiler of Abstract (i.e. medical statistician) and created a surveillance system that has earned him recognition as the founder of the modern concept of surveillance [25, 32].
- 1850 (United States)
  - First link of surveillance to statewide public health infrastructure: Lemuel Shattuck published a report based on a survey of sanitary conditions in Massachusetts and recommended a census and collection of health data [31].

--

- 1854 (London)
  - Father of modern epidemiology: John Snow is widely regarded as the father of modern epidemiology for his work in 1854 in tracing a deadly cholera outbreak to a contaminated water pump on Broad Street [33].
- 1874 (United States)
  - First systematic reporting of infectious diseases: Massachusetts State Board of Health instituted a plan for physicians to provide weekly reports on prevalent diseases, using a standard postcard-reporting format [34, 35].

--

- 1888 (Italy)
  - Mandatory reporting of eleven communicable diseases and death certificates [27].
- 1890 (United Kingdom)
  - Compulsory reporting of infectious diseases [36].

  - Publication of international list of causes of death by the International Statistical Institute (founded in London in 1885) [27].

--

- 1911 (United Kingdom)
  - Use of National Health Insurance data for surveillance [27].
- 1925 (USA)
  - All states participated in national morbidity reporting after the severe poliomyelitis epidemic of 1916 and influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 [37].
- 1935 (USA)
  - First national health survey [27, 36].
- 1943 (Denmark)
  - First registry, the Danish Cancer Registry [27].
- 1943 (United Kingdom)
  - First Sickness Survey [27].

--

- 1965 (Geneva)
  - Establishment of an Epidemiological Surveillance Unit in the Division of Communicable Diseases at World Health Organization headquarters [38].
- 1966 (Geneva)
  - First publication of Communicable Disease Surveillance Reports by World Health Organization [27].
- 1967 (United Kingdom and the Netherlands)
  - Development of General Practitioners’ Sentinel Systems [27].
- 1968 (Geneva)
  - The 21st World Health Assembly established surveillance as an essential function of public health practice [39].

### Uses of public health surveillance.

--

(1) Early warning: serves as an early warning system to identify new emerging health problems
- (i) Recognize cases or clusters of cases to trigger interventions to prevent transmission or reduce morbidity and mortality [98].
- (ii) Serve as an early warning system to identify public health emergencies [79]. 
- (iii) Detect epidemics [36, 99].

--

(2) Impact assessment: assesses public health impacts and trends of new emerging health problems
- (i) Assess the public health impact of health events or determine and measure trends [98].
- (ii) Estimate magnitude of a health problem [36, 99].
- (iii) Document the distribution and spread of a health event [36, 99].
- (iv) Portray the natural history of a disease [36, 99].
- (v) Understand the economic and health impacts of a public health issue, and the nature and extent to which it disrupts communities [77].

--

(3) Intervention development and implementation: develops public health interventions and strategies and allocates public health resources
- (i) Demonstrate the need for public health intervention programs and resources, and allocate resources during public health planning [98].
- (ii) Lead to immediate public health action [75].
- (iii) Set priorities and guide public health policy and strategies [79].
- (iv) Rapidly communicate information among public health officials and health care workers so they can take appropriate actions to resolve problems [77].
- (v) Appropriate and allocate prevention and care resources [36].
- (vi) Make informed decisions related to resource allocation [77].

--

(4) Intervention evaluation: evaluates public health interventions and strategies
- (i) Monitor effectiveness of prevention and control measures and intervention strategies [98].
- (ii) Evaluate control and prevention measures [36, 99].
- (iii) Evaluate programs, policies, and control measures [77].
- (iv) Monitor isolation activities [36, 99].
- (v) Detect changes in health practice [36].
- (vi) Document impact of an intervention or progress towards specified public health targets/goals [79].

--

(5) Risk assessment: identifies risk factors and high risk populations
- (i) Identify high-risk population groups or geographic areas to target interventions and guide analytic studies [98].
- (ii) Monitor changes in infectious agents [36, 99].
- (iii) Understand the factors that cause health events, both at the individual and community level [77].
- (iv) Monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems [80]. 
- (v) Reduce the risk of the occurrence of public health crises [77].

--

(6) Research: supports public health research
- (i) Develop hypotheses that lead to analytic studies about risk factors for disease causation, propagation, or progression [98].
- (ii) Formulating research hypotheses [75].
- (iii) Generate and test hypotheses [36, 99].
- (iv) Identify priorities and hypotheses for research [77]. (v) Facilitate epidemiologic and laboratory research [36].
