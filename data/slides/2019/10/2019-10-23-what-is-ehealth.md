### What is eHealth? 

Development of a Conceptual Model for eHealth: Qualitative Study with Key Informants

--

At that time (and to date), the most cited definition was Eysenbach’s [3]:

<small>
e-health is an emerging field in the intersection of medical informatics, public health and business, referring to health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies. In a broader sense, the term characterizes not only a technical development, but also a state-of-mind, a way of thinking, an attitude, and a commitment for networked, global thinking, to improve health care locally, regionally, and worldwide by using information and communication technology.

### Semistructured interview guide (5)

--

What does eHealth mean to you?

--

What impact do you think it’s having on health care currently, both personally and professionally?

--

What impact do you see it might have over the next 5 years?

--

How do you feel it might contribute to the quality or safety of your own health care or your work as a health professional?

--

What eHealth technologies are being used in your field?

===

#### Responses to “What does eHealth mean to you?” 
ranged from the traditional (representative of current literature):

*eHealth is a way to incorporate technology into health care to promote health and well-being. It can be as simple as using some form of technology to self-monitor your activity, communicate with different people about health and health conditions, coordinating care within the health system, and actively using technology to provide intervention.*

--

to those that could be considered progressive:

*eHealth is so pervasive now[a]days in health research and the implementation of and practice of health that it’s almost like the oxygen [of health]...It involves the collection, the management, the analysis, and the communication of all health-related data. That spans individuals, individual patients, all the way through to entire health care systems.*

--

or possibly contentious:

*You know eHealth is really old fashioned? Nobody talks about eHealth anymore. Electronic health—everything's electronic! The devices, everything! We’re talking about digital health, digitizing health, not eHealth.*

--

and thought provoking:

*eHealth means the ability to dial a doctor from home and the interconnectedness of all of our medical details—it’s the future we were promised from sci-fi!*

===

One participant expressed that:

*To me, eHealth is about the use of new technologies to create new models of care. “E” to me is enabling, how technologies are enabling new delivery, health services, health efficiencies, and overall improvement to health quality.*

--

Participants emphasized that the focus should not be placed on the technologies but on the potential benefits and improvements that they afford; for example:

*It’s not about the technology, it’s about using tools to do what we do, better, faster, safer, more patient-centric, broadening horizons...that’s eHealth.*

--

Participants also highlighted that eHealth implementations need not be overt, as exemplified in the following quote:

*The patient probably won’t even notice eHealth because that just means that we have the right tools in the right place being able to be used by the patients and the clinicians, and really that just supports the delivery of the best possible care.*

===

Analysis of the interview data revealed 3 dominant eHealth domains: 
- (1) health in our hands, 
- (2) interacting for health, and 
- (3) data enabling health, with each encompassing several subcategories (Table 2).

--

Health in our hands: the use of eHealth technologies to monitor, track, and inform health
- Health, not just health care
- Consumer-driven and -controlled health
- Health via social media and the Internet

--

Interacting for health: the use of technologies to communicate between stakeholders in health
- Connecting for real-time health
- Social discourses and storytelling
- New ways of interacting to personalize care Supporting health professionals

--

Data enabling health: the collection, management, and use of health data sources
- Data management systems and data repositories 
- Data for precision health
- Data enabling quality

===

Domain 1: Health in Our Hands

--

I put my pedometer or my fitness app and it tells me how many steps I’ve taken, how many hours I slept. I have a sore throat when I go to Google and gives me information from a huge variety of sources, or I go onto an online support program and I again get access to the stories and the experiences and the recommendations and advice of all sorts of people who have gone through what I’m going through.

--

Health, Not Just Health Care—Solutions for Health and Well-Being

...stop thinking about health and health care as synonymous things and eHealth will encourage that. It’s not about fixing people when they’re unwell; it’s about making sure people are well for as long as they can be.

--

In the prevention end, it’s going to be about consumers owning their own health, and the devices that are available will be there to support them to do that.

--

Consumer-Driven and -Controlled Health

Patients are really the experts here, they’re the people who know themselves best, and they have a great opportunity to be able to contribute information and to really manage that information.

--

I don’t think anybody cares more about the information about a patient than the patient themselves. So if we can show them that information and they can be part of the discussions about that information, that is inherently a very powerful safety and quality measure.

--

Health Via Social Media and the Internet

I think we will go to our [general practitioner] much more knowledgeable, knowing what our problem is, and we will be expecting to have choices offered to us so that we can make reasonable decisions about where we should be going next.

--

So it’s another window into what that patient’s state is...What are questions that’s important to that patient? So rather than spending that time procuring that information in the clinical encounter, they have that available to them.

--

...you have so much access to information in your pocket, when you’re doing things like recharting medications for a patient or explaining something, to be able to pull out your phone and look it up and get the answer right there on the spot.

===

Domain 2: Interacting for Health

--

Connecting for Real-Time Health

The Skype or videoconferencing service was really convenient. He could book in via his Outlook or email system that he would use for work, and treat this like he would a normal appointment, and reduce the time from 2-3 hours with driving to half an hour of purposeful engagement with that health professional.

--

The ceiling camera allows us to communicate with the patient, with the relatives of the patient, and with the nurses, and with the help of the nurses or the emergency department physicians, we are capable to perform an assessment of the patient that just came into the [satellite] department.

--

eHealth, to me, means delivering appropriate care to patients that would have otherwise missed out because of location.

--

Social Discourses and Storytelling

Social media reminds us that our stories are important and our voices need to be heard.

--

New Ways of Interacting to Personalize Care

--

Supporting Health Professionals

So you have to contrast that to what we’ve done traditionally, which is just sort of “one size fits all;” not customized to the patient, to the clinical encounter; not in the workflow...This is all an effort to now have it embedded in the clinical environment.

===

Domain 3: Data Enabling Health

--

Data Management Systems and Data Repositories

--

Data for Precision Health

Working in genetics, I think the idea of having a full set of data is where things become important. You can have lots and lots of data and you can have these huge troves within the genome, but if it’s not connected to the clinical side or the phenotype, it really becomes quite useless.

### Limitations and Future Research

--

Limitations of this study include that the key informant interviews did not include health consumers. Future research could test the assumption that multidomain eHealth initiatives would be more impactful. Further validation through interviews with health consumers would also strengthen the model.

--

The development of this model provides a framework to guide discussion and development of eHealth in practice in a rapidly evolving market. 
- For health professionals, educators, researchers, and consumers, this model may help to inform how eHealth can facilitate coordinated care and wellness into the future. 

--

- For funders of health care, such as governments and health insurers, it provides a framework that can be used to maximize the return of investment on the development of tools to support health and wellness.

--

This includes the development of mobile ecosystems that integrate the 3 domains of this model into easy-to-access and integrated “one-stop shops” for supporting health and wellness and positive behaviors. This model extends current understanding of eHealth by providing clearly defined domains of eHealth while highlighting the benefits of using digital technologies in ways that cross several domains.

--

Perhaps the greatest strength of this model is identifying the “sweet spot” where the domains coalesce to provide the ideal integration of informed consumers, proactive health professionals, and a responsive health system.

--

The model may enable awareness of how eHealth can empower professionals and health consumers alike to be more active participants in ongoing health and well-being management. It may also facilitate greater clinical and organizational understanding of the application of eHealth resources into practice for better outcomes for all.
