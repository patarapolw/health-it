Public health informatics and information system

===

Information Architecture

--

Define the concept of information silos and understand their impact on the practice of public health.

--

Define the concept of a public health shared standards-based data and services model and explain how it can be used to coordinate care according to best practice evidence across individuals, providers and organizations to improve health outcomes for the population.

--

Explain how public health information architecture is simplified through the use of common identifiers and metadata standards, and how the model extends to other public sector domains, such as education and child welfare.

--

Summarize two strategies for moving public health programs from data silos to a shared data and services model.

===

Background

--

Healthy People 2020 [8], which establishes national public health goals for this decade, calls out the role of health information technology (HIT) in building and integrating the HIT infrastructure in alignment with national standards-based initiatives and models to support public health measures and interventions, health literacy, and health communication efforts.

--

the standardized services address the essential functions and roles of public health as first described by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) [9], and later detailed and expanded to include governance by the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) standards and measures [10].

===

Interoperability and Information Architectures

--

Interoperability is defined as the ability of diverse systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate) [12]. Information architecture supplies the standard definitions and protocols for data within the business architecture; the business architecture supports standardized services that address the goals and objectives of the enterprise [13].

--

Information architecture is akin to the data schema for the enterprise. It describes the relationships between entities, including patients, providers, programs, organizations, and evidence-based practice protocols, to achieve the goals of public health.

--

However, there is no universally-accepted information architecture in place today for public health, although work has been done to address public health reporting needs in other models, such as the Federal Health Information Model [14], Public Health Data Standards Consortium [15], the HL7® Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) [16], National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) [17], and the National Human Services Information Architecture (NHSIA) [18]. 

===

Interoperability and the Problem of Information Silos

--

To document the extent of data silos and then to align and systematize the public health program-level work with the IOM and PHAB models, qualitative research was conducted in Oregon in which 142 database silos for 41 state programs were analyzed for content and functionality, and key informants were interviewed con- cerning the purpose of the system and goals of the State programs [12].

--

From that analysis, 36 common services were derived that support programmatic functions. Those common core services were aligned with the IOM and PHAB models to create the Public Health Shared Services Model depicted in Fig. 6.1.

--

Each of the 36 services referenced in the outer and inner rings of Fig. 6.1 are comprised of data and workflow that can be represented in a standardized way that the information architecture aligns and supports.

--

The identified public health services and data that can be shared across programs are grouped below according to the categories of *assessment*, *policy development*, and *assurance*.

--

While data from different services can be structured in a consistent and simplified format using metadata tags, attributes of the data elements will vary across services but remain consistent within a service, so the information architecture should organize each service into its own object or module.

===

Assessment

--

- Identification and Demographics
- Screening
- Registries
- Surveillance
- Testing
- Conduct Investigations and Compliance Reviews
- Response and Mitigation

--

**Identification and Demographics**: Every child, adult, and family served, and every provider of services, organization, and site, needs a unique master identifier [20] that is used to link their records across systems.

--

The information architecture needs to address both the **screening** tool elements, such as result of positive or negative, and the administration schedule, such as at 6 months and 12 months, to enable the data to be used for care coordination.

--

In general, tests can be represented by CPT or LOINC® codes, diagnoses by ICD-9 or ICD-10 or SNOMED-CT® codes, and other agents by other relevant data standards.

===

Policy Development

--

- Health Promotion and Disease/Injury Prevention
- Advise and Consult
- Business Continuity
- Emergency Response Planning
- Health Improvement Planning
- Strategic Planning

===

Assurance

--

- Licensing and Permits
- Rules and Regulations Enforcement
- Health Service Delivery
- Referral
- Eligibility
- Enrollment
- Care Coordination
- Providers
- Training
- Certification
- Performance Measures and Outcomes
- Service Quality and Best Practices
- Governance
- System Management

===

Information Architecture Components

--

- Logical Data Model
- Identifiers
- Knowledge Representation

--

*Vocabulary* refers to the standards-based terminology that will be used to express common data elements. *Metadata* is used to describe the attributes and classify data elements so that they can be grouped, retrieved, and used to trigger alerts and reminders according to evidence-based practice [21]. *Metadata tags* enable disparate data elements to be stored in a common framework and can be used to address issues of interoperability.

--

Value sets relate to the allowable codes and syntax for those codes for a data ele- ment. Much work has been done to develop standards-based vocabularies, meta- data, and value sets, including Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Vocabulary Metadata Standards([22], PHIN Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) [23], and the National Library of Medicine Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus® [24]. However, widespread adoption of those vocabularies has not been achieved at the program level in public health.

===

Applying Information Architecture

--

- Public Health Reporting
- Leveraging National Platform Independent Models

--

Public health has an opportunity to obtain data from EHRs as a result of the HITECH Act of 2009 [25] that was designed to encourage healthcare providers to adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology.

--

Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) was created using the HL7® Development Framework and is intended to be a national standard for sharing clinical information about patients between providers. The content of the CDA is the Continuity of Care Document (CCD) that includes both mandatory textual patient summaries and structured data. The Federal Health Information Model (FHIM) [27] is focused on establishing EHR standards for partners and vendors at the national level, especially concerning information and terminology.

--

The National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) [28] is intended to be a foundation for information exchange. It is based on a common vocabulary and provides a data model, governance, methodologies, training, technical assistance, and an active community to assist users in adopting a standards-based approach to exchanging information.

--

The National Human Services Interoperability Architecture (NHSIA) [29] focuses on sharing eligibility and enrollment information across public health and social welfare agencies and improving service delivery and outcomes for children and families. The Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) [30] is focused on modularizing services and adopting data standards to enable data sharing [31].

--

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Standards and Interoperability Framework, Public Health Reporting Initiative (PHRI), Data Harmonization Workgroup [32] identified the recommended data elements that EHR vendors will need to provide to public health as part of the Stage 3 mean- ingful use criteria for obtaining incentive payments for adopting electronic health records [33]. 

--

To define the common core of data elements, the PHRI and participat- ing stakeholders harmonized user stories and the required data that were submitted by practitioners from different knowledge domains, such as child health and adverse events reporting, to describe how data from EHRs could be used by public health programs. The resulting standards-based Data Harmonization Profile was included in the FHIM for each of the domains analyzed and is available for any public health department to use for its own data harmonization work [34].
