Madden define the Big Data as: "data that’s too big, too fast, or too hard for existing tools to process.”

--

“Too big” means that organizations must increasingly deal with petabyte-scale collections of data that come from click streams, transaction histories, sensors, and elsewhere. 

--

“Too fast” means that not only is the data large, but must be processed quickly, such as carrying out fraud detection or to find an ad to display. 

--

“Too hard”, is a phrase which means that such data may not be easily processed by existing tools, or that needs some more analysis not suited to existing tools.

THE ARCHITECTURE FOR BIG DATA
- Interfaces and feeds
- Redundant physical infrastructure

--

In some cases, this redundancy may come in the form of a Software as a Service (SaaS), allowing companies to carry out advanced data analysis as a service. The SaaS approach allows for afaster start, lowering costs.

--

- Security infrastructure
- Operational data sources
- Performance matters
- Organizing data services and tools
- Analytical data warehouses and data marts
- Reporting and visualization
- Big Data Applications

===

BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES
- MapReduce
- Big Table
- Hadoop

CHALLENGES IN BIG DATA MANAGEMENT

--

The challenges in Big Data can be broadly divided in to two categories: engineering and semantic. 
- Engineering challenges include data management activities such as query, and storage efficiently. 
- The semantic challenge is determining the meaning of information from large volumes of unstructured data.

--

Jones et al., found a number of major challenges to Big Data management.
- High volume of processing using a low-power consumed digital processing architecture.
- Discovery of data-adaptive machine learning techniques that are able toanalyze data in real-time.
- Design scalable data storages that provide efficient data mining.

--

On the other hand, Patidar, Rane and Jain have identified a number of key challenges in Big Data management related to the cloud as follows:
- Data security and privacy;
- Approximate results;
- Data exploration to enable deep analytics;
- Enterprise data enrichment with web and social media;
- Query optimization; and
- Performance isolation for multi-tenancy.
