Box 1: Recommendations for developers of guideline- based CDSS

--

- In line with user-centered design:
  - physicians are to be involved from an early stage in the design and development of the guideline-based CDSS. In doing so, physicians’ doubts and negative beliefs (such as beliefs that the CDSS will harm patient-physician communication) are mapped and addressed through implementation plans.
  - physicians should receive hand-on training and tailored education before deployment of a system.

--

- Guideline-based CDSS should:
  - provide patient-specific recommendations, that are relevant for the clinical situation at hand.
  - provide a holistic overview of the patient.
  - should be intuitive and easy to use: user interactions and time to use the system should be kept to a minimum.
  - be integrated with EMR or CPOE systems.

--

- Guideline recommendations should:
  - be clearly visible on the screen in a visually oriented design.
  - include explanation about the recommendation.
  - be timed in line with physicians’ individual daily working practices and preferences (before, during or after patient visits).

### Summary points

--

What was already known on the topic?
- Clinical guidelines are still under-utilized in clinical practice. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can offer physicians patient-specific advice based on guideline recommendations, thereby overcoming obstacles in the use of traditional paper-based guidelines.
- Even though the evidence of CDSSs improving clinical performance and patient outcomes is convincing, the failure rate in introducing CDSS in clinical practices is still high.
- Studies evaluating CDSS implementations continue to provide insight into factors influencing or issues surrounding CDSS introduction.
- While evidence on the impact of factors associated with guideline-based CDSS implementation is discussed and wide-spread, a synopsis of the literature is absent.

--

What this study added to our knowledge?
- This literature review provides an integrated and differenti- ated understanding of factors influencing implementations of guideline-based CDSS used by physicians by use of a sociotechnical framework.
- The data analyses show clear gaps in research on organizational factors associated with implementations of guideline-based CDSS.
- Future research should focus on an integrated analyses of factors impeding or facilitating CDSS implementa- tions. Sociotechnical frameworks should guide this type of research.

### System use

--

Expectations and beliefs (n = 32)
- Belief that CDSS use hampers the physician-patient relationship [6,21,32–34]
- Belief that CDSS might disturb the patient [32]
- Belief that CDSS is an intrusion to clinical practice [32,35,36]

--

Knowledge and expertise (n = 32)
- Unskilled and lack of experience in computer use [24–28,34]
- Lack of familiarity with the new system or similar systems [20,23,28,30,34]
+ Inexperienced (or young) staff are likely to benefit most of system implementation [6,19,21,22,25,26,29]

--

Motivation to use (n = 13)
- Physicians consider themselves experts not needing decision support [21,32]
- Presence of obvious medical indication [32]
- No system benefit because of uncertain patient cases/patient complexity [21,29,30]

--

Training (n = 12)
+ Users receive initial hands-on training [6]
+ Users receive concise and tailored education [24]

===

### Structure

--

Clinical process (n = 28)
- Time constraint to use CDSS during a patient consultation [25,26,28,30–32,34,39–41]
+ System is fitted to routine care [19,23,31,33,34,40,42,43]

===

### Information quality

--

Relevance (n = 25)
- Recommendations lack a holistic perspective of the patient [25,27,28]
+ Recommendations are relevant for the clinical situation at hand [29,31,33,34,40,41,43,45,46]

--

Completeness (n = 15)
+ System provides explanation for a recommendation [20,22,39,45,47,48]

--

Format (n = 14)
+ System design is visually oriented [23,41]
+ Recommendations are clearly visible on the screen (positioning) [40,46]

--

Timing (n = 15)
+ Recommendations are available at the point of decision making [31,49]

===

### System quality

--

Ease of use (n = 23)
+ System is intuitive [6,41,45]
+ System is user-friendly [6,24,25,29,31–33,37,40,41,43,45,46,48]

--

Efficiency (n = 21)
- The time required to use the system is too long [21,32,33,36,39,40,42,43,45] 
+ User interactions are minimized [6,23,25,33,34,45,48]

--

Compatibility (n = 13)
+ CDSS is integrated with CPOE or EMR [23,24,36,42,45,49]

The human, organization, technology-fit (HOT-fit) framework

--

![image.png](/api/media/2019-10-30t022223.326z)

--

The HOT-fit framework is based on earlier models for evaluating information systems (IS); 
- the IS Success Model by DeLone and McLean [13] and 
- Information Technology (IT)-Organization Fit Model by Scott-Morton [14]. 

--

The IS Success Model is well known for its comprehensive, specific evaluation categories, extensive validation and its applicability to HIS evaluation. 

--

The IT-Organization Fit Model is known for its concept of fit complementing the HOT-fit framework [10].

--

Human, organizational and technological factors can be mapped onto seven interrelated dimensions; 
- human factors to the dimensions 
  - System use and 
  - User satisfaction, 
- organizational factors to the dimensions 
  - Environment and 
  - Structure, and 
- technological factors to the dimensions
  - System quality, 
  - Information quality and 
  - Service quality. 

--

The framework is completed with an eight dimension, 
- Net benefits, 
  - which captures the impact of a system on the individual clinician or healthcare organization.
