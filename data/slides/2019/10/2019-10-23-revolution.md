### What’s holding up the big data revolution in healthcare?

Poor data quality, incompatible datasets, inadequate expertise, and hype

--

Current practices around collection, curation, and sharing of data make it difficult to apply machine learning to healthcare on a large scale.

===

Part of the problem is that the hype surrounding machine learning obscures the reality that it is just a tool for data science with its own requirements and limitations. 

The hype also fails to acknowledge that all healthcare tools must work within a wide range of human constraints, from the molecular to the social and political.

===

Although machine learning is the state of the art in predictive big data analytics, it is still susceptible to poor data quality, sometimes in uniquely problematic ways. 

--

Machine learning, including its more recent incarnation deep learning, performs tasks involving pattern recognition (generally a combination of classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering). The ability to detect even the most subtle patterns in raw data is a double edged sword: machine learning algorithms, like humans, can easily be misdirected by spurious and irrelevant patterns.

--

For example, medical imaging datasets are often riddled with annotations—made directly on the images—that carry information about specific diagnostic features found by clinicians. This is disastrous in the machine learning context, where an algorithm trained using datasets that include annotated images will seem to perform extremely well on standard tests but fail to work in a real world scenario where similar annotations are not available. 

--

Since these algorithms find patterns regardless of how meaningful those patterns are to humans, the rule “garbage in, garbage out” may apply even more than usual.

===

Improved data management is clearly necessary if machine learning algorithms are to generate models that can transition successfully from the laboratory to clinical practice. How should we go about it? Effective data management requires specialist training in data science and information technology, and detailed knowledge of the nuances associated with data types, applications, and domains, including how they relate to machine learning. 

--

This points to a growing role for data management specialists and knowledge engineers who can pool and curate datasets; such experts may become as essential to modern healthcare as imaging technicians are now. Clinicians will also need training as collectors of health data and users of machine learning tools.

--

To truly realise the potential of big data in healthcare we need to bring together up-to-date data management practices, specialists who can maximise the usability and quality of health data, and a new policy framework that recognises the need for data sharing. Until then, the big data revolution (or at least a realistic version of it) remains on hold.
