Today IDC's Digital Universe Study predicts that between 2009 and 2020 digital information data will grow by 44% from 0.8 ZB to 35 ZB. Many surveys expect that volume of data will grow by 45% in the next two years, and few said it will be doubled.

### EVOLUTION OF 14 V’s AND 1C OF BIG DATA CHARACTERISTICS

--

In 2001, industry analyst Doung Laney (currently with Gartener), articulated the mainstream of definition of big data in terms of three V's: Volume, Velocity, and Variety.

--

4 V’s of Big Data

SAS (Statistical Analysis System) has added two additional dimensions i.e. Variability and Complexity. Further, Oracle has defined big data in terms of four V's i.e. Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity.

Oguntimilehin. A, presented big data in terms of five V's as Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, Value and a Complexity.

--

10 V’s of Big Data

In 2014, Data Science Central, Kirk Born has defined big data in 10 V’s i.e. Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Validity, Value, Variability, Venue, Vocabulary, and Vagueness.

--

1 | Volume | Size of Data | Quantity of collected and stored data. Data size is in TB
2 | Velocity | Speed of Data | The transfer rate of data between source and destination
3 | Value | Importance of Data | It represents the business value to be derived from big data
4 | Variety | Type of Data | Different type of data like pictures, videos and audio arrives at the receiving end
5 | Veracity | Data Quality | Accurate analysis of captured data is virtually worthless if it’s not accurate
6 | Validity | Data Authenticity | Correctness or accuracy of data used to extract result in the form of information

--

11 | Variability | Data Differentiation | Data arrives constantly from different sources and how efficiently it differentiates between noisy data or important data
12 | Venue | Different Platform | Various types of data arrived from different sources via different platforms like personnel system and private & public cloud
13 | Vocabulary | Data Terminology | Data terminology likes data model and data structures
14 | Vagueness | Indistinctness of existence in a Data | Vagueness concern the reality in information that suggested little or no thought about what each might convey
15 | Complexity | Correlation of Data | Data comes from different sources and it is necessary to figure out the changes whether small or large in data with respect to the previously arrived data so that information can get quickly

--

7 | Volatility | Duration of Usefulness | Big data volatility means the stored data and how long is useful to the user
8 | Visualization | Data Act/ Data Process | It is a process of representing abstract
9 | Virality | Spreading Speed | It is defined as the rate at which the data is broadcast /spread by a user and received by different users for their use
10 | Viscosity | Lag of Event | It is a time difference the event occurred and the event being described

### NEED FOR MORE EXPLORATION OF BIG DATA

--

S.Vikram Phaneendra and Madhusdhan Reddy discussed that the data was less and can be easily handled by RDBMS but now-a-days it is not possible through RDMS tools, to manage big data. Because big data is different from other data in terms of five characteristics likes Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Value.

--

Kiran Kumar Reddy and Dnvsl Indira, have explained that big data is in the form of Structured, un-structured, massive homogenous and heterogeneous. They have also advised to use a better and modified model to handle and transfer of big data over the network.

--

Wei fan and Albert Bifet explored big data mining, as the capability of taking out the useful information from large data sets due to its characteristics likes volume, variability and velocity. It was not possible to do it before. So, researchers and practitioners have explored the big data in terms of volume, velocity, variety, variability, velocity, variety, value, virality, volatility, visualization, viscosity and validity.

--

In 2016, Experian discussed that 97% of US businesses are seeking to achieve a complete view of their customer, but the biggest problem organisations are facing is big data management. US government accountability office has shown that five of the six most damaging data thefts of all time have happened in the last two years

### NEW 3 V’s OF BIG DATA CHARACTERISTICS
- Verbosity
- Voluntariness
- Versatility

--

#### Verbosity

Keeping in mind the verbose nature of the big data, we have identified ‘verbosity’ as one of the characteristic of big data which is defined as “The redundancy of the information available at different sources.”

--

The consequences of storing these types of information may be dangerous sometimes. So, it is recommended to check that the stored data is secured, relevant, complete, and trustworthy. If a suitable technique at the initial stage is applied to decide whether the information is useful or not, then storage space, as well as processing time can be saved.

===

#### Voluntariness

Keeping in mind the voluntary behaviour of the big data, ‘voluntary’ has been defined as one of the characteristic of big data which is defined as “The will full availability of big data to be used according to the context.”

===

#### Versatility

we have identified ‘versatility’ as one of the characteristic of big data which is defined as “The ability of big data to be flexible enough to be used differently for different context.”
