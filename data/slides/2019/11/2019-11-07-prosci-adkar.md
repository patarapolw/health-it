ADKAR is an acronym that represents the five milestones or outcomes an individual must achieve for change to be successfully realized: *awareness, desire, knowledge, ability and reinforcement*.

--

1. Awareness of the business reasons for change. Awareness is a goal/outcome of early communications related to an organizational change.
2. Desire to engage and participate in the change. Desire is a goal/outcome of sponsorship and resistance management.
3. Knowledge about how to change. Knowledge is a goal/outcome of training and coaching.
4. Ability to realize or implement the change at the required performance level. Ability is a goal/outcome of additional coaching, practice and time.
5. Reinforcement to ensure change sticks. Reinforcement is a goal/outcome of adoption measurement, corrective actions and recognition of successful change.

===

The ADKAR Model is useful in:

- Diagnosing employee resistance to change
- Helping employees transition through the change process
- Creating a successful action plan for personal and professional advancement during a change initiative
- Developing a change management plan for your employees

### THE ADKAR MODEL IN A PERSONAL CHANGE

--

Awareness: 
- are you aware of the need to exercise? 
- Why should you start an exercise regimen? 
- Some things that may build your awareness are reading articles or seeing news reports that describe the health benefits of regular exercise, from weight control to preventing disease and reducing stress.

--

Desire: 
- do you have the personal motivation to start exercising? 
- A lot of people are aware of the need to exercise but might not have found the personal desire to start. Desire is a very individual concept. 
- Your motivation may be that you want to lose weight to better keep up with your kids; or you have a need for more physical strength at work; or maybe you’re looking for a way to reduce anxiety. 
- Regardless of what your motivation is, you must make a personal decision to make this change, based on your own unique motivations.

--

Knowledge: 
- do you know how to effectively and safely exercise? 
- This is where you need to gain some knowledge. 
- Perhaps you hire a personal trainer to teach you the basics, attend an exercise class with an instructor or order a workout video or book. In order to effectively change, you need to know how.

--

Ability: 
- can you put your knowledge into practice? Just because you know how to do something, does not mean you can actually do it. 
- We often need coaching when implementing new behaviors, so you may need additional practice time with a personal trainer to build up to doing exercises effectively or with proper form. 
- Or perhaps conflicting time commitments are preventing you from being able to exercise and you need to rearrange other priorities to make the time.

--

Reinforcement: 
- do you have reinforcements in place to prevent you from reverting to your old habits? 
- In this example, you may have a reward system for yourself when you hit certain exercise milestones. 
- Or you might have a workout buddy who holds you accountable for showing up to the gym.

--

Note that each of the five elements of the ADKAR Model represents a particular result that you are trying to achieve. Also note that all elements are cumulative and must be performed in order.

===

### THE ADKAR MODEL IN AN ORGANIZATION

--

Awareness:
- “This is a waste of time.”
- “It was working just fine before.” 
- “They never tell us what’s going on!”

--

- “How soon will this happen?”
- “How will this impact me?”
- “Will I receive new training?”

--

Desire:
- “I’m not interested in changing.” 
- “What’s in it for me?”
- “I doubt they are really serious about this.”

--

Knowledge

--

Ability:
- “I’m not getting these new steps right.”
- “I eventually get there but it takes me twice as long.”
- “I understand the manual, but when I have to do it, I freeze.”

--

Reinforcement:
- “The new way just takes too long; I’m going to keep doing it my way.” 
- “I keep forgetting to include the new department.”

### ADKAR EXERCISE - IMPLEMENTING THE ADKAR MODEL

--

To begin, identify a friend, family member, work associate or employee in whom you want to see a particular change take hold. Choose an individual who is not having success, despite your best efforts to support them through the change.

--

ACTIONABLE STEPS

--

If awareness is needed: 
- discuss and explore the reasons and benefits for this change, both on the organizational level and on the individual level.

--

If more desire is needed: 
- to move this person forward, you must address their inherent desire to change (which may stem from negative or positive consequences). The motivating factors have to be great enough to overcome the individual’s personal threshold to resisting the change.

--

If more knowledge is needed: 
- avoid dwelling on reasons for change and motivating factors, as this could be discouraging to somebody already at this phase. What is needed is education and training for the skills and behaviors necessary to move forward.

--

If more ability is needed: 
- at least two steps are required. 
- First, time is needed to develop new abilities and behaviors. 
- Second, ongoing coaching and support is required - a one-time training event or an educational program may not be adequate. Consider outside intervention, continued support and mentoring.

--

If more reinforcement is needed: 
- investigate if the necessary elements are present to keep the person from reverting to old behaviors. Address the incentives or consequences for not continuing to act in the new way.
